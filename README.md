# linux-dfl-backport
Backport version of the linux-dfl (Device Feature List) kernel driver for FPGA devices. This is an out-of-tree driver, designed to be built, packaged, and installed as a stand-alone set of driver modules.

This is a community project. Individual branches may be owned/maintained by different individuals or organizations to support specific kernel versions.  For example, one branch may be designed specifically to compile against all RHEL 8 kernels, and it may also provide support for building a DKMS package that will build the binary files on the target machine when it is installed. Another branch may build for both RHEL 8 and Ubuntu 22.04.  Others maybe be intended for building binary RPMs for specific kernels.

Branches are only supported by the individual owners for the purposes for which the branches were created. However, you are free to copy and modify any of the branches within the constraints of the GPL V2 license as described in the included LICENSE file.

If you would like information on a particular branch, please use the github "Discussions" link to start a conversation. If you can describe your goal, others members should be able to help you determine where to start.
